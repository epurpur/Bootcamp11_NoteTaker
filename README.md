  ## Description

  My assignment is to modify starter code to create a Note Taker application that can be used to write and save notes. The application will have an Express.js back end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file. The application's front end has already been created. It is my job to build the back end, connect to the front end, and deploy the application to Heroku.
